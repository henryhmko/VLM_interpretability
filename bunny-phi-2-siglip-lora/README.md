üìñ [Technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11530) | üè† [Code](https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/Bunny) | üê∞ [Demo](http://bunny.dataoptim.org/)

Bunny is a family of lightweight but powerful multimodal models. It offers multiple plug-and-play vision encoders, like EVA-CLIP, SigLIP and language backbones, including Phi-1.5, StableLM-2 and Phi-2. To compensate for the decrease in model size, we construct more informative training data by curated selection from a broader data source. Remarkably, our Bunny-3B model built upon SigLIP and Phi-2 outperforms the state-of-the-art MLLMs, not only in comparison with models of similar size but also against larger MLLM frameworks (7B), and even achieves performance on par with 13B models.

The model is pretrained on LAION-2M and finetuned on Bunny-695K.
More details about this model can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/Bunny).
